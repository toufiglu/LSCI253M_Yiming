```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error=FALSE, warning = FALSE)
source("library.R")
```

```{r}
data <- read_csv("data/example_data_for_visualization.csv")
mean_VOT <- data %>% 
  group_by(label, type) %>% 
  summarise(mean_vot = mean(vot)) %>% 
  ungroup()

p <- mean_VOT %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=label, y=mean_vot, fill=label)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_grid(~ type) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")
  
p
```

From the above analysis, it seems that VOT is longer for voiceless sounds than voiced sounds. There does not seem to be differences across different word classes.
